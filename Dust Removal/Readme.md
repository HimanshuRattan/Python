# Dust Removal
This essentially is implementation of the Dust Removal Paper, with several other tweaks applied to it. This model can be used of removing hazyness and bluryness from the input image. 
Works effectively for underwater images
This code is perfroms the following procedures:
1. Taking Video or Image as Input.
2. Video is broken down into frames and saved as images.
3. These Images are then passed through the Dust removal code.
4. Then these produced images are again recombined to produced the Video wih the cleared images with variable frame rate.

The IPNYB file was made in Google colab.
The file is ready to use, after you have made relevant changes to the PATHS inside the file.

Happy Coding :)
