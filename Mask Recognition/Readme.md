# Mask Recognition
Hello Guys!

This is my Project for Mask Recognition. I was able to have an accuracy of 93%.

I have attached the dataset and the ipnyb file too for your use guys. 
You can directly download and start using it.
Would def love to hear suggestions from your side. 

Thanks and Happy Coding!
